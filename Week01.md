## ‚úÖ Things to do today!

### Team Formation 
- [ ] Form a team of 5-6 members (ideally 6, NO groups of 4 or less! It is YOUR responsibility to ensure that you are in a group by the end of the term, **failure** to do so will mean that you are **no longer** able to continue with the course. Please take the initiative to use the Edstem, Group Finding channel and reach out to me if you need help finding a group.)
- [ ] Decide on a Scrum Master (their role is to manage the project and play a leadership role, they contribute *slightly* less code)
- [ ] Assign a Product Owner (their primary role is to manage communications with the client)
- [ ] Register your team on Moodle

### Jira and GitHub Classroom
- [ ] Setup Jira (ideally the Scrum Master)
- [ ] Join the GitHub Classroom, you can find instructions for both on Moodle!

### Choosing a Project
- [ ] Read through the list of projects that you can choose from on Moodle
- [ ] Fill out the Project Selection Questionnaire (only ONE member i.e. Scrum Master should submit this)

## ‚≠ï Action Items for Week 2

- [ ] Work on your Fundamentals Primers (5%, due in Week 3 Lab)
