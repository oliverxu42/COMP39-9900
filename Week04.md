In next week's lab time we will be having our first progressive demo A for your first sprint! 
Here is what will be expected of you during the demo:

### General Requirements
- **Duration:** 10-12 minutes
  - Penalties: Presentations that are too short and lack depth may be penalised.
  - Hard Limit: The presentation will be cut off at 12 minutes.
- **Preparation:**
  - Submission Deadline: Submit a recording of your demo by **Sunday, Week 5 at 9 pm.**
  - I recommend teams just set up a phone to record their in person demo and upload that video.
  - Online labs can just use the screen recording.
- **Team Participation:**
  - Speaking Requirements:
    - Multiple team members must speak.
    - At least 2-3 people should have relatively equal speaking time.
    - Not everyone needs to speak, but presence is mandatory for all team members during the demo.
    - Online: Cameras must be on - 📷 **No camera = No attendance!** 

> **⚠ Absence during the demo will result in a mark of 0.**

### Choosing a time slot!

- You must attend for the full duration of all teams' demos.
- We will have four 30 min time slots.
- Let's choose your time slots: https://wheelofnames.com/

## 🎭 Retrospective A
- Teams should hold a retrospective meeting as soon as possible after Progressive Demo A.
- A retrospective is Scrum practice where the team meet to conduct a reflective activity to identify potential issues and improvements of the teamwork process over the past sprint. The Scrum practice requires considering and discussing:
  - what went well,
  - what did not go so well, and
  - what the team should try over the next sprint to improve their team work process.

> **⚠ Absence during the retrospective meeting will result in a mark of 0.**
