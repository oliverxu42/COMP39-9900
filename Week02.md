# Week 2 üçå

Hi again, welcome to week 2! üòÄ

## üõéÔ∏è Week 1 Re-cap 

By now you should all have...
- [x] Formed your group and established **communications**.
- [x] Setup all **tools and platforms** e.g. Github Classroom, Teams etc.
- [x] Started on your software engineering **primer activities** (due next week)
- [x] Know which **project** you will be working on!
- [x] Established communications with your **client**.
- [x] Read through the **project proposal** report specs.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Client communications
- The **Product Owner** is responsible for all direct contact with the client, such as via emails, but the **whole team** should be attending meetings with the client.
- Clients come in many different styles. Some may be more prescriptive and direct, others more open and loose. The Product Owner should make decisions to turn what the client says into **tangible scope/features,** and actions that the rest of the team can start developing on. 
- Questions students might ask their client include:
  - What does an MVP for the product look like? Versus the final deliverable?
  - What features are nice to have, versus must have?
  - Can you see the project being delivered in different stages? What features would be in each?
  - Are there any external dependencies (APIs, datasets, etc) that we need? When can we get them?
  - Who are the main users that benefit from this product? How can we more deeply understand their voice throughout our project life cycle?

## ‚úÖ Things to do today!

1. Come up with a **group alias** (can be anything, just helps when clients are trying to identify groups) 
2. Start working on your project **proposal report** (it's due Wednesday 11:59 am, Week 3!)
3. Continue working (ideally finish) your software engineering **primers** (due Week 3 lab, must **show me your work!**)
4. Get confident with the **agile methodology** and how **scrum** works.

## ‚≠ï Action Items for Week 3

- [x] Finish software engineering primers.
- [x] Finalise your proposal report (due Wednesday).
- [x] Attend the weekly Industry Workshops.
- [x] Get prepared to start your first sprint!
